# SQL
An SQL problem solving

## The process of structured problem solving in SQL can be summarized as follows:

1. **Visualize the required output**: Clearly understand the desired outcome of your query. Determine the columns that need to be included in the result set.

2. **Identify the rows to be selected**: Use filters such as the WHERE and HAVING clauses to specify the conditions that the rows must meet in order to be included in the result set.

3. **Define the data granularity**: If necessary, use aggregations such as the GROUP BY clause to determine the level of detail or granularity at which the data should be grouped.

4. **Consider using CTEs or subqueries**: Complex queries can benefit from the use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) or subqueries to break down the problem into more manageable parts and improve query organization.

5. **Validate individual sections:** Test and validate each section of the query independently to ensure that it produces the expected results. This helps in identifying any issues or errors early on.

6. **Combine and stitch smaller pieces**: Once you have validated the individual sections, combine them together to obtain the entire solution. This may involve using joins to combine data from multiple tables.

7. **Check for row explosion**: When performing joins, be cautious of potential row explosion, where the number of rows in the result set increases significantly. This can happen if the join conditions are not properly defined or if the data relationships are not accurately represented.

By following these steps, you can effectively structure your problem-solving approach in SQL and write queries that address specific challenges or requirements.
